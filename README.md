This repository contains SQL Analysis of HR Gender Diversity and Equality

I worked on a HR Analytics dataset for a company, with the aim of providing useful insights to the stakeholders and supporting the business. The dataset was made available by FP20 as part of an ongoing Data Analytics challenge. The analysis was carried out using SQL, and the dataset was cleaned to retrieve relevant information. The columns in the dataset include Employee ID, date of birth, employee age, surname, name, gender, marital status, branch, hire date, leave date, leave reason, status, department, employee satisfaction, annual salary, bonus, total compensation, job title, job description, manager(Y/N), and performance.
The analysis involved retrieving information such as employee gender diversity and equality, average salary by department, employee satisfaction, job titles with the highest and lowest satisfaction scores, and more. The findings of the analysis can be used to support decision making and improve the company's HR policies and practices.
The code used for the analysis is available on this repository, and can be used as a reference for similar analyses in the future.


Based on the information made available , these are my recommendations

To improve employee gender diversity and equality in the organization, the following actions can be taken:
1.	Implement gender-blind hiring practices, including removing gender identifiers from resumes and conducting blind interviews.
2.	Offer unconscious bias training to all employees to help eliminate any unconscious biases that may exist.
3.	Provide equal opportunities for career development and advancement, including mentoring and leadership programs.
4.	Conduct regular gender pay gap analyses to identify and address any disparities in compensation.
5.	Establish a diversity and inclusion committee to promote and support gender diversity and equality initiatives.
6.	Create a family-friendly workplace culture by offering flexible work arrangements and childcare support.
7.	Increase the representation of women in leadership positions and on the board of directors.
8.	Foster an inclusive work environment by promoting respect and open communication among all employees.
